This is the Python Expense Tracker.
It is used to track your expenses and make predictions based on those expenses. Right now it makes very simple predictions but it can be made to be more accurate with a better formula and structuring of sorting predictions. A savings plan part is also included but it is not very helpful at the moment the predictions made from the data and other factors like user budget and current market prices related to categories can be added and taken into account to provide more useful financial advice in the future. The categories are also very general and not very easy to categorise into, more research can be done to see which categories are useful to users or are not used at all. Categories can then be added or removed. Currently it is good at tracking your expenses because each expense can be viewed and total amounts can also be seen in a clear cut way so the hassle of calculating everything is removed for the user. I designed it so that user can enter and store an expense each time they have made one but i understand how that can also be tedious, the program could've been made to be more convenient for users who would want to enter and categorise expenses at once.
