# python-expense-tracker
A multi-purpose command-line application designed to track monthly expenses for each year, predict usersâ€™ expenses for the upcoming months and help plan out savings to reduce expenses.

Completed in 2023. This was my submission for the coursework component of the module
'Principles of Programming', part of the Computer Science Bachelor's Degree course by UWE (University of West England) for the first year. With this submission I got 54 marks out of 100 for the component, a passing grade. A coursework specification document is available in the repo for further reading on assessment details.

# Installation
Either set up a python virtual environment for this project and then, using python pip installer install the packages listed in requirements.txt or install the same way without setting up one (Only installing matplotlib will do in this case as the other packages listed are just dependencies for the library) 

Upon installation, open and run the file expense-tracker.py in a code editor such as 'VS Code' and enter the corresponding numbers; the command-line interface will guide you through it's functionalities.
